Context

You are working with a mobile-first web application.

The goal of this task is to implement the UI layer (HTML, CSS, minimal JavaScript) based on the provided specification and screen designs.

This is NOT backend work and NOT database implementation yet.
Focus on structure, layout, states, and interaction behavior.

Provided materials

You are given three types of files:

1) Word documents (English only)

A. Functional specification

File: User_M_Specification_en_unified.docx

Contains:

product purpose,

UX logic,

screen descriptions,

state logic (points, assigned / completed),

behavioral rules.

B. Screen map & screen descriptions

File: screen_map_and_description_Engl.docx

Contains:

explicit screen-to-screen navigation map,

detailed per-screen descriptions,

UI elements,

behavior,

navigation,

additional notes on data dynamics.

👉 These two documents are the single source of truth.
If something is not described there — do not invent it.

2) Screen designs (visual layouts)

You are given:

PNG files (final visual layout reference),

SVG files (vector reference),

additional PNG files for complex visuals (e.g. charts).

Important clarification:

These images are NOT just inspiration.

They are visual layout specifications:

spacing,

hierarchy,

element placement,

proportions,

mobile vertical orientation.

However:

Text, numbers, names, dates, and values in images may be placeholders.

Real values will be injected dynamically later.

👉 Treat images as UI layout to be implemented,
👉 Treat text inside images as illustrative placeholders unless specified otherwise.

Target platform & scope
Platform

Mobile-first web app

Primary layout: mobile, portrait orientation

Implementation: HTML + CSS + minimal JavaScript

Out of scope (for now)

Database implementation

API integration

Authentication

Persistent storage

Responsive layouts for tablet / desktop (can be prepared structurally, but not finalized)

What to implement
1) HTML structure

Semantic HTML for all screens.

One logical container per screen.

Clear separation of:

headers,

content areas,

action areas,

overlays / modals.

2) CSS

Mobile-first styles.

Match spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy from designs.

Implement:

default state,

hover / press / active states (for mouse and touch),

disabled states where described.

Colors, gradients, rounded cards, buttons — follow designs closely.

3) JavaScript (lightweight)

JavaScript is used only for:

screen switching,

state toggling,

UI reactions.

At this stage:

Do NOT implement real data loading.

Do NOT connect to a real database.

Instead:

Use mock data objects or placeholders.

Clearly separate logic so that:

data sources can later be swapped (DB vs in-memory).

Data handling model (IMPORTANT)

The UI uses three kinds of data:

1) Static UI text

Examples:

button labels,

section titles,

helper texts.

These:

are fixed strings,

may change only when designers update copy,

are NOT fetched from the database.

2) State-dependent UI data

Examples:

which buttons are visible,

which actions are enabled,

which screen variant is shown,

Assigned vs Completed states,

empty / partial / completed week logic.

These:

depend on application state,

should be controlled via JS state variables,

must be easy to adjust later.

3) Dynamic content data (future DB data)

Examples:

activity cards,

week ranges,

points,

pillar lists,

activity metadata.

For now:

represent them as mock objects / arrays.

clearly mark places where real data will be injected later.

👉 The code structure should make it obvious where dynamic data will come from, even if it is mocked now.

Navigation rules

Follow the screen map exactly as defined in screen_map_and_description_Engl.docx.

Screen transitions must match the map.

Cycles (returning to previous screens) must be preserved.

Overlays (info / feedback dialogs) are not standalone pages.

Screens to implement (order recommended)

Screen_1a / Screen_1b — Welcome

Screen_2 — Week selection

Screen_3 — Weekly Dashboard

Screen_4-1_0 — Pillar selection

Screen_4-1_1 — Activity type selection

Screen_4-1_2 — Activity list

Screen_4-2_0 — My list

Screen_4-2_inf_1 — Activity info / feedback overlay

Charts & complex visuals

Charts are UI components, not images.

Use the provided PNG/SVG as visual reference.

Implement charts structurally (HTML/CSS or simple JS), not as static images.

Data values are dynamic; appearance is fixed by design.

Output expectations

Produce:

clean, readable HTML,

modular CSS,

minimal, well-structured JavaScript,

clear comments explaining:

where state changes,

where data is injected,

where future DB integration will occur.

Avoid:

over-engineering,

unnecessary frameworks,

assumptions not present in the documents.

Final instruction

Implement exactly what is described.
Do not invent new screens, flows, or logic.
If something is ambiguous, prefer the Word specification over visual guesswork.
